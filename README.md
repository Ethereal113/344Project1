# 344Project1
This repository has all of the supporting documentation for project 1, including the final report, SQL script files and the model files created using MySQL Workbench.
The final report contains an overview of the project, what the database aims to achieve and the results of the implementation and testing. 
the .mwb file is the model file and contains the template for the database created with Workbench, including the ER diagram that is included in the final report.
The .sql file contains the forwarding code used to create the database from the model, and the subsequent code I appended to show the population of the tables, 
and the testing of those tables using a few simple SELECT queries.
